To build the documentation:

* Make sure Sphinx is installed (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html). 
Here are some links that will help you understand some of the documentation code.
	http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html
	http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/doc/openalea/doc/_build/html/source/sphinx/rest_syntax.html

* in the docs directory type: "make html" - Sphinx will start and generate html documentation
* under the newly created _build directory, open the index.html file to see your generated documentation.
